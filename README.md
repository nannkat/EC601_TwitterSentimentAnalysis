## Milestone 1(a) - Experimenting with the Twitter API

After getting access to the API I experimented with some requests to some endpoints from my visual studio code environment.\\
For help with interacting with the API via Python I found this tutorial helpful: https://towardsdatascience.com/an-extensive-guide-to-collecting-tweets-from-twitter-api-v2-for-academic-research-using-python-3-518fcb71df2a
. As well as the [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library in python.

The results of this experimentation are stored in a jupyter notebook under the examples folder.

I first started with the basics, exploring a user data endpoint. For that I used my own old twitter account. I tried expanding the information fields to get metadata, setting different time boundaries,
and changing the default result count.

Moving on to the search endpoint I tried querying by topics and time. I tried querying for tweets on the Icelandic government elections going on this evening along with all tweets on cats and dogs in english within the last hour that included pictures.

It was very fun and I look forward to working with the API.
